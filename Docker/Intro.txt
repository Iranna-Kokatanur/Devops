Docker Parts:
1) Runtime -> Basically allows us to start and stop the containers.
            Two types : 1) runc -> start and stop the containers (Low level)
                        2) containerd -> Managing the runc and how to interact the container with the internet (pulling the image from the internet) (High level)
2) Engine -> to interact with the docker (Docker Daemon)

          Interacting with the docker -> [Docker CLI -> Rest API -> Server Daemon -> Runtime -> create the tasks] (Client server Architecture)

3) Orchestration -> 1. If you are applications are running on 10000 containers, if you want to scale it up you can increase more containers
                    2. If the containers are got ruined, you need to restart all these containers
                    3. If you want to make it version 01 to 02 in the containers.

                    These takes will take lot of time if you do it maually, then it requires lot of monitoring. Then these orchestration tool like Kubernates comes into pic.
