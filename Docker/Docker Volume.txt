DOCKER VOLUME MOUNT:

docker run -it -v C:\Users\AC96810\Downloads\Docker:/root/ alpine:latest /bin/sh 

docker run -it -v [docker host: container inside path] image /bin/sh

1. Without login to container I can access what is inside the root
2. Even If i loose the container the data will be there in my C:\Users\AC96810\Downloads\Docker folder
3. It will not increase the size of the running container [because whatever you are creating inside the running container it will be visible, but will sit in C:\Users\AC96810\Downloads\Docker]
4. Whatever the new files is added in the container will be present on C:\Users\AC96810\Downloads\Docker not vice versa.
5. It is just sharing the folder of container [majorly help in recovery if i loose the container]
6. we can share accross multiple containers by specifing path

docker volumen ls
