docker run -it [image name] -> (-it means interactive mode (means dont exit out of the container)) ->
                                This command will run the image to form the container.
                            -> If didnt find the image in local system then it will look for the docker hub (Docker Registry)

docker pull [image name with version (not mandate)] -> It will download the image from private registry (docker registry)

docker ps -> processes

docker container ls -> container list

docker images -> images list

docker container exec -it [containerid] bash -> bash will attach to running container (docker run -it ubuntu:16.0)

docker stop [container_id] -> It will stop the container

docker ps -a -> show the running containers, stopped one.

docker rm [container_id] -> remove the container

docker inspect [container_id] -> Info of container running [container has to run for this (run in -it mode)]

docker logs -> Logs

docker container prune -f -> Remove all stopped containers (-f -> dont ask) -> (prune for stopped containers)

docker run alpine ping www.civo.com -> Download the alpine and will ping the www.civo.com
