1. Rolling update

Once you deployed the app in the nodes, consider you want to go for new version of the image then what you do with the same deployment name
you can do new deployment, then what will happen the new pod which have new update will come up and other pods will go down and changes can
be seen in the browser. (you dont need to delete the service and deployment, just apply the new yaml file with newer image)

-> earlier consider v1.0 then you want to go v2.0

-> kubectl apply -f new.yaml
-> kubectl rollout status deployment <deployment name>
-> kubectl rollout history deployment <deployment name>
-> watch kubectl get pods

-> Consider if you want to go back to previous version, you can either change yaml file with v1.0 and do apply or

-> kubectl undo rollout deployment <deployment name> --to-revision 1  (revision number based on how many rollouts)
-> This above command will make to rollback to previous version

-----------> So here no require of downtime
