Pod ->
-> Abstraction over container
-> It will create layer on container, it will abstract the container runtime so that you can replace them or you dont have to run with any
container tool like docker. Means you can interact with kubernetes layer
-> Usually one application per pod
-> each will get its own get ip(internal)
-> This can die very easily
-> new ip when new pod created
-> when two pods wants to communicate, if they are communicating through ip then when pod dies it will loose ip and come up with new ip,
so, because of that pod will use service for communication

Ingress ->
It will make the external connection with the service to interact with the pods

Ingress -> service -> node -> pod

Configmap ->

It wil have the configuration of the application. Consider if the url changes in the application,
you dont need to rebuild the application. you can just add in configmap because it will directly with the config map.

Secrets -> 
It will the secrets like consider dockerhub url and username and password

Volumes ->

Physical hardware mounting with pod so that if pod destroys no loosing of data

How zero down time will happen?
Service can two methods: Own can permanent ip or loadbalancer.
the replicas of has to be deployed in multiple nodes or single node. If the pod is the down, service will route the traffic to other.
this will happen by Deployments

Deployments (abstraction of pods) ->
It will create more replicas, if pod down, it will make it to spin up again.

StatefulSet -> It is same like Deployments which will help for replicas of pods and autoscaling. It is basically for 
databases. (Databases should be created using statefulset only due to data consistancy). 

----Databases will never be replica using Deployment because 
database has a state which pods are writing or reading, it will have data inconsistancy. So, either it will happen by statefulset or keep 
the db outside k8 cluster.

Stateful can't be easy so mostly databases will be kept outside k8 cluster in general.

Worker machine in K8 cluster:

-> Multiple nodes
-> each nodes has multiple pods in it.
-> 3 processes must be installed in every nodes
     1. container runtime
     2. kubelet -> interacts with container runtime and the worker node. It start the pod with container inside and it will assign 
        the resources from node to the container.
     3. kube-proxy -> It will forward the request perfectly and avoid the network overhead . (Example if the db running making request to one
      pod, it will make the forward the request to same node instead of other node)
-> the communication between the pods will happen through the services.
