You can deploy the application using any service like nodeport or ClusterIP. INGRESS has IP which is loadbalancer.
 When someone hit the request based on the endpoint it will go to corresponding service and pods and make a call.


kubectl get ingress -> It will have the loadbalancer ip, where you can access the request

kubectl edit deployments <deployment name>
