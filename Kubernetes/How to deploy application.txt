EXAMPLE:

     DB Service                     Backend Service                 Front service

     Database pod                   Backend pod                     Frontend pod

1. How communication happens between pods in k8

-> Using service names not through ip (when pod reran there is a chance of change of ip),
in the application you need to configure the name of service (you want to use db one, add its service)
