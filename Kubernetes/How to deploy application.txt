EXAMPLE:

     DB Service                     Backend Service                 Front service

     Database pod                   Backend pod                     Frontend pod

1. How communication happens between pods in k8

-> Using service names(because it is static) not through ip (when pod reran there is a chance of change of ip),
in the application you need to configure the name of service (consider backend pod want to communicate with db pod one, add its db service)
