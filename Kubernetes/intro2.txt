Commands:

2) kubectl version --output=yaml
3) minikube start (use docker desktop driver)
4) minikube status
5) kubectl get pods
6) Kubectl get nodes
7) Minikube dashboards -> minikube dashboard
8) minikube docker-env
9) docker container ls -> For docker containers list used by minikube
10) minikube ssh -> inside minikube we have docker runtime, you can check what all runnning using [docker ps] command.
11) kubectl config view -> about cluster
12) kubectl config current-context
13) kubectl get all -> it will give service, pods and everything

We said deployment to run 4 pods always. Deployment is also a controller.

kubectl delete pd [pod name]

even if you delete the pod, it will restart the pod because initially we said api server to run 4 pods.

kubectl get depolyments -> give the deployments

kubectl delete deployments [deployment name] -> will delete the deployments, and related pods will also get terminated.
